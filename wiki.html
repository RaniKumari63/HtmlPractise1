  <p><a href="#">Constantine III </a>(died 411) was a common Roman soldier who<br /> was declared <a href="#">emperor</a> in <a href="#"></a>Roman
    Britain</a> in 407.
    He moved to<br /> <a href="#">Gaul</a> (modern France), taking all of the mobile troops and their <br />commander <a href="#">Gerontius</a> from
    Britain to confront bands of <br /> <a href="#">Germanic invaders</a>. Constantine stabilised the situation and <br /> established
    control over Gaul and <a href="#">Hispania </a>(modern Spain and <br />Portugal).<a href="#"> Honorius</a>, <a href="#">the Western Roman emperor</a>, sent
    an army <br />to expel Constantine's forces. After initial victories it was repulsed.
    In early 409 Honorius recognised Constantine as co-emperor. Constantine in turn raised his oldest
    son <br />to co-emperor as <a href="#">Constans II</a>. In 409 Gerontius rebelled, defeating and killing <br />Constans in early
    411.
    Meanwhile, Honorius<br /> appointed a new general, <br /><a href="#">Constantius</a>, who besieged Constantine in <a href="#">Arles</a>.
    A relief force was ambushed and <br />he <a href="#">abdicated</a>, took <a href="#">holy orders</a> and – promised his life – surrendered.
    Constantius<br /> had lied: Constantine was killed and his head presented to Honorius on a pole in <br />
    September 411.</p>
